# Installation

First, go to the [TLA+ Home Page](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) and navigate to the link for [The Toolbox](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html), about the middle of the webpage. Then, click through "Obtaining the Toolbox", then "Downloading the Toolbox". Clicking [Download From Github](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/latest), find the `*.zip` file that has `linux` on it. Click and download the zip file.

For Linux, extract the contents of the zip file in a subdirectory you want. In the command prompt, you can change to the `toolbox` subdirectory and run the Toolbox by executing `./toolbox` in that subdirectory.
