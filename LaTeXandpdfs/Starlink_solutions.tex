\section{Introduction}

A casual conversation with Anthony Rose (SpaceX) about the challenges facing SpaceX's Starlink prompted further private discussions amongst the two authors about possible solutions and novel approaches.

\part{Outline of Solutions}

\section{Watchdog Timer} 

Let $i = 0 , 1, \dots N_{\text{WD}} - 1$, where $N_{\text{WD}} = $ total number of Starlink satellites with a Watchdog (WD) timer.

Let $t_{0,i} \equiv t_{0i}$ be the time each Watchdog Timer $i$ gets initialized. This is when the internal watchdog timer begins counting.

Suppose the time duration for a WD timer to "expire" or "timeout" (i.e. once $t_{\text{WD}}$ time elapses, the WD rests to either indicate something went wrong, or on purpose) is chosen to be same $\forall \, i = 0 ,1, \dots N_{\text{WD}} -1$.

either / or 

Because it's not safety critical, but mission assurance.

Let $T_{\text{WD}}$

\section{Network Map}

"Ping loops"

One could begin by thinking of the network of Starlink satellites in terms of \emph{graph theory}: the vertices $V$ would be each of the satellites, possibly including the ground station(s), and edges $E$ are the "connections" or "pipes" between each of the satellites.

However, we would posit that this is not enough; the satellites are in "real", \emph{physical} space. Being that comes all the nuances of physical space, including "pseudo-locality" (some satellites are closer to each other than another group of satellites; this isn't captured in graph theory). 

Thus, we would posit that this is also an \emph{embedding} problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The way to tackle this is with \emph{topological graph theory}. 

\section{Predict the next $n_k$ frames and send them}

The goal is to predict the packet that should've been received.

\subsection{Send a Checksum after $N_p$ packets}

To ensure data integrity, we can send a \emph{checksum} after each $N_p$ packets. This checksum can be decoded with \emph{polynomials}. This is also an opportunity to leverage concepts from \emph{algebraic geometry}. In algebraic geometry, in a qualitative sense, the "eigenvectors" of a polynomial can be found, and this "basis" can be used to help decode the checksum with a minimum or small overhead (for machinery).

\section{Open LST}

We would broadcast in UHF.

\section{Orbital Parameters}

We would broadcast an \emph{error code}. This error code would include a NIDI and a timestamp.
